PROBLEM
A company that rents out bikes wants to use a model to predict the number of bikes that will be rented out on a given day. The model will take into account various factors such as the date (month, day, whether it is a holiday or weekend), as well as weather data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) to make accurate predictions about bike rental demand. This will help the company to better plan for staffing and bike inventory, and optimize revenue.
