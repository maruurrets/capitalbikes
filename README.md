# CAPITAL BIKES SHARE
## PROBLEM
A company that rents out bikes wants to use a model to predict the number of bikes that will be rented out on a given day. The model will take into account various factors such as the date (month, day, whether it is a holiday or weekend), as well as weather data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) to make accurate predictions about bike rental demand. This will help the company to better plan for staffing and bike inventory, and optimize revenue.

Navigate to the src/data directory and then run the following commands:

### To see te solution showed in the video:
python make_dataset_sol.py

### To see my solution:
python make_dataset_5models.py

### To se the scores and best hyperparameters for the selected model
python gradientboosting.py


* These scripts are a bit different in code and model types but arrive to the same result.
